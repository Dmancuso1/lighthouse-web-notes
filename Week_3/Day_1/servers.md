# What is node.js, what are servers, what are frameworks?

## What is 'Express'?

first lets make a server with strictly node,js. then we will build it again with express to compare. 


```
// example of node server creation..
const http = require('http');
const PORT = 3001;

http.createServer(function (req, res) {
  console.log(req) // <- req and res are large objects provided by node via the createServer method>
})
.listen(8080);
```

`req` = stuff client inputs to server.

`res` = stuff that will be sent to client



## What is a `route` ?
example: const route = `${req.method} ${req.url}`;

# What is routing?

Routing refers to how an applicationâ€™s endpoints (URIs) respond to client requests. Each endpoint (or route) can have one or more handler functions, which are executed when the route is matched. See http://expressjs.com/en/guide/routing.html.

### We will be focusing more on express rather than straight node for making a server. see lecture notes.
