# Object Oriented Programming.


## Summary of OOP features that we covered:
We learned the following features about Classical OOP:

A `class` is a blueprint from which instances of objects can be created (i.e. newTask vs a task)
Classes have data in the form of value properties and behaviour in the form of methods
Classes can `inherit` behaviour from other classes using the `extends keyword`
Subclasses can override methods that are inherited in their superclass
JavaScript also gives us `get and set keywords` to more cleverly define methods that are data getters and setters
